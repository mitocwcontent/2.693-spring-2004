description: MAVS current meter with differential acoustic travel-time sensor using
  the two rings for transducer support. An inductive conductivity cell in orange and
  a stainless steel needle permit salinity and temperature to be measured. Paper towelling
  collects drips from the pressure sensor filled with oil on the end cap. Weichang
  Li looking on. Photo by Dr. Albert J. Williams 3rd.
