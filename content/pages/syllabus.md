Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Labs: 1 session / week, 3 hours / session

Course Goals
------------

This course provides the ocean scientist and engineer with an:

1.  Understanding of the theoretical and practical principles of making measurements in the ocean,
2.  An introduction to basic oceanographic instrumentation being used today,
3.  The requirements, methodology and sampling strategies related to designing scientific and environmental monitoring programs,
4.  An appreciation of issues relating to the analysis and presentation of results.

Lectures
--------

Oceanography is an observational field that requires quality observations to support scientific investigations. Therefore, it is imperative that the oceanographic student think in terms of the observational requirements (rather than just sensors) when designing an experiment. This including consideration of the sensors (type, calibration, response, and techniques for the user of), sampling theory (sample interval, duration, statistical confidence), data systems (microprocessors, data compression, conditional sampling, and data storage), data analysis and presentation of the results (that meet the scientific, management, observational goals). This class is an introduction to sensors and measurements and their use in the ocean. Various "state-of-the-art" measurement systems will be described and discussed during the semester. Classroom lectures will be supplemented with readings, speakers, and the student will be assigned problem sets.

Laboratory
----------

During the semester, students will work in the laboratory understanding circuits and instrument systems then prepare and deploy them in the ocean. The class will study several instrument systems in detail during the semester. Other exercises will help the student understand filters, op-amps, analog and digital circuits, microprocessors, and the use of laboratory test equipment. Then the students will design a simple deployment, prepare the instrumentation and supporting hardware/software and deploy the instruments from the R/V TIOGO or ASTERIAS for one week. The student will be required to work up the cruise for a final class report and make an oral presentation of the findings.

Course work will include assigned problems sets involving data manipulation and presentation of results using MATLAB®. Presentation of a final report on the laboratory projects will be given to the class (and others) at the end of the semester in place of a final exam. Grades will be assigned based on the student's performance on the assigned homework, participation in class discussions, and on the laboratory project.

Readings
--------

This subject is not covered sufficiently by any textbook. Students are provided with course notes written by the instructors, and supplemental readings from the literature.

Other Coursework
----------------

Course work will include assigned problems sets involving data manipulation and presentation of results using MATLAB®.

Presentation of a final report on the laboratory projects will be given to the class (and others) at the end of the semester in place of a final exam.

Grading
-------

Grades will be assigned based on the student's performance on the assigned homework, participation in class discussions, and on the laboratory project.
